            These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explains the terms and
            conditions by which you may access and use https://app.uniswap.org,
            a website-hosted user interface (the “Interface” or “App”) provided
            by Uniswap Labs (“we”, “our”, or “us”). You must read this Agreement
            carefully as it governs your use of the Interface. By accessing or
            using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and
            agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not
            agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and
            should not use the Interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a
            binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of
            which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The
            Interface is only available to you — and you should only access the
            Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface provides access to (a) a decentralized protocol on
            various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum,
            that allow users to trade certain compatible digital assets (“the
            Uniswap protocol” or the “Protocol”); and (b) an aggregator of
            various third-party non-fungible token (“NFT”) marketplaces (the
            “NFT Marketplace Aggregator”). The Interface is one, but not the
            exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet software,
            which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your
            relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by
            the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this
            Agreement. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated
            with us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of
            your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its
            contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to
            be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein
            by reference.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Modification of this Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this
            Agreement from time to time. If we make any material modifications,
            we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement
            and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at
            https://uniswap.org/terms-of-service. All modifications will be
            effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use
            of the Interface will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of
            those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to
            this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the
            Interface.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Description of Services provided through the Interface</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of accessing (a)
            the Protocol and (b) the NFT Marketplace Aggregator.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>a. Interface for accessing Protocol</h3>
            <p>
              The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not
              the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol
              itself has three versions, designated as v1, v2, and v3, each of
              which comprises open-source or source-available self-executing
              smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains,
              such as Ethereum. Uniswap Labs does not control or operate any
              version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the
              Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling
              digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity
              pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol.
              When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity
              providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Labs is not a
              liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity
              providers are independent third parties. The Protocol was
              initially deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and has since been
              deployed on several other blockchain networks including by parties
              other than Uniswap Labs. Deployments on other networks typically
              make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one
              blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note
              that digital assets that have been “bridged” or “wrapped” to
              operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains
              compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to
              ensure the Ethereum blockchain can effectively process more
              transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to
              as “Layer 2” solutions) are distinct from the original Ethereum
              mainnet asset.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>b. NFT Marketplace Aggregator</h3>
            <p>
              The NFT Marketplace Aggregator is a series of smart contracts that
              allows you to discover, buy, and sell NFTs simultaneously across
              multiple third-party marketplaces (each a “Third-Party
              Marketplace”). Your use of the NFT Marketplace Aggregator is
              subject to the additional terms and conditions contained in the
              NFT Marketplace Aggregator Addendum.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Eligibility</h3>
          <p>
            To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally
            binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at
            least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old
            in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority
            to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for
            which you may access or use the Interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic
            or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental
            authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or
            restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained
            by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of
            the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a
            jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive
            country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the
            United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of
            the Interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and
            regulations, and that you will not access or use the Interface to
            conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
          <p>
            We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Interface
            and its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text,
            images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, designs, and
            its “look and feel.” This intellectual property is available under
            the terms of our copyright licenses and our Trademark Guidelines.
            Unlike the Interface, versions 1-3 of the Protocol are comprised
            entirely of open-source or source-available software running on
            public blockchains.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the Interface to list, post, promote, or display NFTs, you
            grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free
            license to use, copy, modify, and display any content, including but
            not limited to text, materials, images, files, communications,
            comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, concepts, questions, data,
            or otherwise, that you post on or through the Interface for our
            current and future business purposes, including to provide, promote,
            and improve the services. This includes any digital file, art, or
            other material linked to or associated with any NFTs that are
            displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all
            rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority
            necessary to grant the rights granted herein for any NFTs that you
            list, post, promote, or display on or through the Interface. You
            represent and warrant that such content does not contain material
            subject to copyright, trademark, publicity rights, or other
            intellectual property rights, unless you have necessary permission
            or are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant
            us the license described above, and that the content does not
            violate any laws.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>DMCA Complaints</h3>
          <p>
            The NFT Marketplace Aggregator merely aggregates the results from
            Third-Party Marketplaces. These Third-Party Marketplaces are
            operated independently from us by unrelated third parties, and we
            have no control over any content, information or other materials
            contained within such Third-Party Marketplaces. If you believe that
            your copyrighted work is being displayed on a Third-Party
            Marketplace, has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
            infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been
            otherwise violated, you should notify that Third-Party Marketplace
            of your infringement claim in accordance with their defined
            reporting procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, despite our position as an aggregator, Uniswap Labs
            will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and
            will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright
            Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with
            respect to any alleged or actual infringement on the NFT Marketplace
            Aggregator. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should
            be submitted to the Uniswap Help Center. Please complete the form.

            Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that they are
            solely initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment
            advice from us in connection with any trades, including those you
            place via our Auto Routing API; and (c) we do not conduct a
            suitability review of any trades you submit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may provide information about tokens in the Interface sourced
            from third-party data partners through features such as rarity
            scores, token explorer or token lists (which includes the Uniswap
            Labs default token list and Uniswap Labs expanded list hosted at
            tokenlists.org). We may also provide warning labels for certain
            tokens. The provision of informational materials does not make
            trades in those tokens solicited; we are not attempting to induce
            you to make any purchase as a result of information provided. All
            such information provided by the Interface is for informational
            purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a
            recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound
            investment. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action
            based on any information contained in the Interface. By providing
            token information for your convenience, we do not make any
            investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any
            transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for
            determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related
            transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment
            objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.

          <h3>Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do
            not ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets
            at any time. It further means you are solely responsible for the
            custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset
            wallets you hold and you should never share your wallet credentials
            or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or
            liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make
            no representations or warranties regarding how the Interface will
            operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are solely
            responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any
            acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your
            wallet being compromised.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose
            any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
            you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or
            liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any
            such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those
            duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived,
            and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and
            obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this
            Agreement.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Compliance and Tax Obligations</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in your
            jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that
            you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws
            and regulations that may apply to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, your use of the Interface or the Protocol may result
            in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax,
            value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain
            jurisdictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any
            transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or
            remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Assumption of Risk</h3>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are
            financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
            inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of
            the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as ether (ETH),
            so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those
            following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20).
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital
            assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including
            (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security,
            and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token,
            including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely
            claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk
            that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called
            stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be
            fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and
            runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, you understand that smart contract transactions
            automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based
            transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and
            accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may
            increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and
            accept the risk of selecting to trade in Expert Modes, which can
            expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher
            costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you act as a liquidity provider to the Protocol through the
            Interface, you understand that your digital assets may lose some or
            all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through
            the Interface due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a
            trading pair or liquidity pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you understand that we do not create, own, or operate
            cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or
            warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge,
            including its use for Uniswap governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of
            these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and
            cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience
            while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand
            and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of
            accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Third-Party Resources and Promotions</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface may contain references or links to third-party
            resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials,
            products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition,
            third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of
            the Interface. We do not approve, monitor, endorse, warrant or
            assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions. If
            you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions,
            you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement
            does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third
            parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising
            from your use of any such resources or participation in any such
            promotions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Release of Claims</h3>
          <p>
            You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with
            your access and use of the Interface. You further expressly waive
            and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action,
            or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the
            Interface. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits
            and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides:
            "[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or
            releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
            favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him
            or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with
            the debtor or released party."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Indemnity</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and
            our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates,
            and subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations,
            losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your
            access and use of the Interface; (b) your violation of any term or
            condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any
            other applicable law, rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party's
            access and use of the Interface with your assistance or using any
            device or account that you own or control.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>No Warranties</h3>
          <p>
            The Interface is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. TO
            THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS
            AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
            INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You acknowledge and agree that
            your use of the Interface is at your own risk. We do not represent
            or warrant that access to the Interface will be continuous,
            uninterrupted, timely, or secure; that the information contained in
            the Interface will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current; or
            that the Interface will be free from errors, defects, viruses, or
            other harmful elements. No advice, information, or statement that we
            make should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the
            Interface. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility
            for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties
            concerning the Interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the Protocol is provided "AS IS", at your own risk, and
            without warranties of any kind. Although we contributed to the
            initial code for the Protocol, we do not provide, own, or control
            the Protocol, which is run autonomously without any headcount by
            smart contracts deployed on various blockchains. Upgrades and
            modifications to the Protocol are generally managed in a
            community-driven way by holders of the UNI governance token. No
            developer or entity involved in creating the Protocol will be liable
            for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use,
            inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the
            Protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
            exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits,
            cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. We do not
            endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements,
            offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the
            Interface.

          <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
            EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR SUBSIDIARIES BE
            LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
            CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO)
            DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER
            INTANGIBLE PROPERTY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACCESS OR USE
            OF THE INTERFACE, NOR WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS,
            OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED
            ACCESS OR USE OF THE INTERFACE OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN
            IT. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY: (A) ERRORS,
            MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (B) PERSONAL INJURY OR
            PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM ANY ACCESS
            OR USE OF THE INTERFACE; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF ANY
            SECURE SERVER OR DATABASE IN OUR CONTROL, OR THE USE OF ANY
            INFORMATION OR DATA STORED THEREIN; (D) INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF
            FUNCTION RELATED TO THE INTERFACE; (E) BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES,
            OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE INTERFACE; (F)
            ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF
            THE USE OF, ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INTERFACE; AND
            (G) THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD
            PARTY.

        <div>
          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes
            through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute
            arises, you must contact us by sending an email to legal@uniswap.org
            so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal
            dispute resolution. If we aren't able to reach an informal
            resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both
            agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set
            forth below. Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to
            the Interface, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for
            which you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited
            to) any claim or controversy as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall
            be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the JAMS
            Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures. You understand that you
            are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The
            arbitration shall be held on a confidential basis before a single
            arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to JAMS rules. The
            arbitration will be held in New York, New York, unless you and we
            both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the
            arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other
            party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
            entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual
            capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class
            action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
            representative proceeding. This provision applies to class
            arbitration. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a
            trial by jury.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to
            principles of conflict of laws, govern this Agreement and any
            Dispute between you and us. You further agree that the Interface
            shall be deemed to be based solely in the State of New York, and
            that although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions,
            its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal
            jurisdiction in any forum outside the State of New York. Any
            arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed
            by the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that the federal and state
            courts of New York County, New York are the proper forum for any
            appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the
            event that this Agreement's binding arbitration clause is found to
            be unenforceable.

          <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with
            respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any
            and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements,
            communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the
            subject matter of the terms.

          <h2>NFT Marketplace Aggregator Addendum</h2>
          <p>
            This NFT Marketplace Aggregator Addendum applies to your use of the
            NFT Marketplace Aggregator made available by us through the
            Interface.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>NFT Transactions</h3>
          <p>
            The NFT Marketplace Aggregator enables transactions involving NFTs
            that are listed on Third-Party Marketplaces. The listing information
            and pricing for NFTs is determined by the corresponding Third-Party
            Marketplace on which the NFT is listed. Uniswap Labs does not
            determine what to list or set pricing for NFTs on those Third-Party
            Marketplaces. You bear full responsibility for verifying the
            identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase
            from third-party sellers using the NFT Marketplace Aggregator and we
            make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or
            authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such
            NFTs) visible on the Interface. We also cannot guarantee that any
            NFTs visible on the Service will always remain visible and/or
            available to be bought, sold, or transferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in will be
            processed via automated smart contracts. Once executed, we have no
            control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the
            ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no
            liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages
            that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you
            engage in via the NFT Marketplace Aggregator, or any other payment
            or transactions that you conduct via the NFT Marketplace Aggregator.
            Except as expressly provided for herein, we do not provide refunds
            for any purchases that you might make on or through the NFT
            Marketplace Aggregator.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Gas Fees</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to
            the appropriate network (“Gas Fees”). Except as otherwise expressly
            set forth in the terms of another offer by Uniswap Labs, you will be
            solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that you
            initiate via the NFT Marketplace Aggregator.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Sweeps</h3>
          <p>
            The NFT Marketplace Aggregator may include functionality designed to
            enable the purchase of all or substantially all of the NFTs in a
            particular collection (a “Sweep”). By executing a Sweep, we will
            promptly execute a batched smart contract-based transaction on your
            behalf to purchase the NFTs that are part of the Sweep. In the event
            one or more NFTs are not available at the time we execute the
            purchase transaction with the corresponding Third-Party Marketplace,
            we will refund to your wallet the pro-rata portion of the purchase
            price for any NFTs that were unavailable, less any Gas Fees. You
            agree and acknowledge that Uniswap Labs does not guarantee that a
            Sweep will be successful in acquiring all of the NFTs in a
            particular collection or that you will achieve any particular
            financial result or outcome or otherwise obtain any particular
            economic benefit by executing a Sweep.

          <h3>Transaction Royalties</h3>
          <p>
            NFTs available for purchase through the NFT Marketplace Aggregator
            may contain smart-contract terms that specify certain royalties
            which are payable to the original creator or another individual in
            connection with a subsequent sale of the NFT (a “Transaction
            Royalty”). The NFT Marketplace Aggregator does not impose any
            additional Transaction Royalties on NFT transactions. However, the
            NFT Marketplace Aggregator will pass-through any Transaction
            Royalties to the extent imposed by the underlying Third-Party
            Marketplace on which the Digital Asset is originally listed for
            sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs may be subject to terms imposed by their creators with respect
            to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated with a given
            NFT. For example, when you click to get more details about any of
            the NFTs visible on the Interface, you may notice a third party link
            to the creator’s website. Such websites may include additional terms
            governing the use of the NFT that owners of the NFT will be required
            to comply with. We are not a party to any such intrinsic NFT terms,
            which are between creators, sellers, and buyers. The buyer and
            seller are entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating,
            agreeing to, and enforcing those terms, and you are solely
            responsible for reviewing such terms.

          <h3>Rewards</h3>
          <p>
            In connection with your historic or current use of the NFT
            Marketplace Aggregator, we may provide you certain incentives,
            prizes or rewards for completing certain activities, such as
            completing a certain number of transactions (“User Rewards”).
            Details regarding the criteria for earning a reward will be
            described within the Interface or official Uniswap Labs
            documentation. Upon satisfaction of the criteria for obtaining a
            reward and subject to your compliance with the associated rewards
            terms, this Agreement, and applicable law––to be determined
            exclusively by Uniswap Labs—we will use commercially reasonable
            efforts to promptly transfer the earned reward to the digital wallet
            that you designate or have connected to the NFT Marketplace
            Aggregator. We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue or
            cancel any rewards programs (including the frequency and criteria
            for earning such User Rewards), at any time and without notice to
            you.

          <h3>Assumption of Risk – NFTs</h3>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the NFT Marketplace Aggregator, you recognize
            there are certain inherent risks associated with transactions
            involving NFTs. You agree and acknowledge:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>
              NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in
              the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). Any transfers or sales
              occur on the associated blockchain, and we cannot effect or
              otherwise control the transfer of title or right in any NFTs or
              underlying or associated content, items, or rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to
              volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can
              also materially and adversely affect NFT prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with
              content created by third parties through peer-to-peer
              transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing
              counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to
              metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that
              may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have
              done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell,
              obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may flag certain items as suspicious when Third-Party
              Marketplaces do so. We do not develop these flags ourselves and we
              attempt to propagate those flags as soon as possible. We do not
              make any representations or warranties about the accuracy of those
              flags. We may similarly hide NFTs or collections, making them
              inaccessible on the NFT Marketplace Aggregator. Under no
              circumstances shall the inability to view items or an inability to
              use the Interface in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or
              transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds
              for a claim against us.
