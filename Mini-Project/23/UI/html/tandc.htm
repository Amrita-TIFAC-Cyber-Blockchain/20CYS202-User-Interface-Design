                    <p>Welcome to FriendFinder’s Terms and Conditions of Use (these “Terms”). This is a contract between you and the FriendFinder Group (as defined further below) and we want you to know yours and our rights before you use the FriendFinder website or application (“FriendFinder” or the “App”). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).</p>
                    <h2>1. FriendFinder RULES</h2> 
                    <p>Before you can use the App, you will need to register for an account (“Account”). In order to create an Account you must:</p> 
                    <ol> 
                    <li>be at least 18 years old or the age of majority to legally enter into a contract under the laws of your home country; and</li> 
                    <li>be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.</li> 
                    </ol>
                    <p>You can create an Account via manual registration, or by using your Facebook login details. If you create an Account using your Facebook login details, you authorize us to access, display and use certain information from your Facebook account (e.g. profile pictures, relationship status, location and information about Facebook friends). For more information about what information we use and how we use it, please check out our <a href="/en-us/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using our App, you acknowledge that we may collect and use of your data and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person’s Account or to share your Account with any other person without permission.</p>
                    <p>You’ll have great fun on FriendFinder, but if you feel the need to leave, you can delete your Account at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ page when you are logged in and clicking on the ‘Delete account’ link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content (defined below) to be completely removed from the App. Your profile information will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you delete your Account and try to create a new account within this time period using the same credentials, we will re-activate your Account for you.</p>
                    <p>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts and messages for content that indicates breaches of these Terms. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, restrict access to the App, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice. Without limiting the foregoing in any way, we expressly reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Account without notice (1) for violating these terms, (2) due to your conduct on the App, or your conduct with other users of the App (including your “offline” conduct), if we, in our sole discretion, determine your conduct was inappropriate or improper, (3) if we or our affiliates, in our or their sole discretion, determine your conduct on other apps operated by our affiliates was inappropriate or improper, or (4) for any reasons whatsoever that we deem, in our sole discretion, justifies termination. If your Account is terminated or suspended, you agree you will not receive a refund for any paid service or features you have already been charged for.</p>
                    <p>You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our systems. Certain portions of the App may not be accessible if you have not registered for an Account.</p>
                    <h2>2. TYPES OF CONTENT</h2> 
                    <p>There are three types of content that you will be able to access on the App:</p>

                    <li>content that members provide (“Member Content”); and</li>

                    <h3>Your Content</h3> <p>You agree that Your Content must comply with our Guidelines at <a href="https://FriendFinder.com/en/guidelines">https://FriendFinder.com/en/guidelines</a>, as updated from time to time. As Your Content is unique, you are responsible and liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content. Sorry that was a bit of a mouthful, but you are what you post! </p>
                    <p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.</p>
                    <p>As FriendFinder is a public community, Your Content will be visible to other users of the App all around the world instantly - so make sure you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. As such, you agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is sent a link to the App (e.g. individuals who receive a link to a user’s profile or shared content from other FriendFinder Users). By uploading Your Content on FriendFinder, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licenses to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide license to use Your Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).</p>
                    <p>We may assign and/or sub-license the above license to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you. </p>
                    <p>We do not have any obligation to store Your Content - if it’s important, you should make a copy.</p>
                    <p>So that we can prevent the unconsented use of Your Content by other members or third parties outside of FriendFinder, you authorize us to act on your behalf with respect to such infringing and/or unauthorized uses. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, for us to send takedown notices (including, without limitation, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices)) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of FriendFinder.</p>
                    <h3>Member Content</h3> <p>Other members of FriendFinder will also share content via the App. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed via the App at the direction of the user providing the Member Content. </p>
                    <p>You do not have any rights in relation to other users’ Member Content, and you may only use other FriendFinder users’ personal information to the extent that your use of it matches FriendFinder’s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users’ information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, stalk or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your Account if you misuse other users’ information.</p>
                    <p>Member Content is subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 512(c) and/or 512(d) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998. If you have a complaint about Member Content, please see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act section below for more information.</p>
